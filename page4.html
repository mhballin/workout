            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p><strong>What is strength Training</strong>?</p><p>There is an emphasizes of <strong>lower reps</strong> (4 to 6) then higher reps (6 to 15+). Lower reps allow you do move the most weight, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4562558/">which is the fastest and msot effective way to gain strength</a>&nbsp;(check this science shit out)</p><div>
</div><div><strong>Strength Training&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Well what are you lifting?&nbsp;</strong></div><div>Well weights obviously. More in depth it will all be based on percentages of your <strong>1 Rex Max (1RM)</strong>. Your 1RM is a weight that you can currently do. It is a weight (let’s say for benching) that you can perform one rep with good form. My 1RM for benching is 154 right now, however this is not the most accurate right now because I just started tracking this. Right now, your 1RM for the main exercises you will be performing will not be 100% accurate because it’s very hard to know exactly what yours is (don’t try and go lift super heavy weights to figure it out, that will get your hurt, it can be calculated). 
</div><div>
</div><div>So according to reddit, the conversion of DB bench to Barbell bench is 0.363. So, if your benching 25 for 10 reps you can do roughly 70 for 10 reps also on a bench press. Using a one rep max calculator it suggest that your 1RM is around 95lbs.  
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">So, using a similar method each of the weights your will be lifting every workout will be calculated based on the 1RM for that exercise. For the main exercises, you can <strong>easily track your progress</strong> by caculating your 1RM.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>How is Muscle built?
</strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;I think it’s very important to know exactly why you are doing what you are doing in your workouts. One of the most important things about working out is making a plan you understand and can see progress. Now progress doesn’t happen overnight. We will be having 4-week cycles in our program. So, you might not think that you are seeing any progress, however over time you could be progressing. 
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">So how do I get stronger? (why are you mentioning this). </span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>VOLUME</strong>, so, let’s say that you do push-ups every few days for three months.  You start out doing 15 a day and maybe progress to 25 to 30 (this is quite hypothetical). This is an instance of progression there is the same intensity in all the workouts. This means that when you do pushups you are always using the same weight on your muscles and thus the intensity is never increasing (unless you’re getting fat). This is where volume comes into play. Yes, you can increase your muscle mass by just doing push-ups, however you can do this much faster (if done right) with weights. Volume is (reps X sets X Intensity). The way that you increase the volume, in this program is by having one main lift of the day<strong> T:1</strong> an accessory lift <strong>T:2</strong> and a third tier <strong>T:3</strong> the foundation of it all. Let’s get into each of these tiers. If you want to know more about volume and other stuff check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS6bYmuvJ8M" target="_blank">this</a> YouTube video and this channel if you want. What the tiers are doing is T:1 is expanding the capacity (weight) that you can lift, then T:2 and T:3 are filling that in with high reps. If you don’t understand fully that’s ok, it should make more sense later. 
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><strong>Keep in mind all what you are going to see, until we get to your workout, will be not what you are doing. Its from different websites and this is taking a very long time to write this and you’re not paying me so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><br></div><p></p></div>
